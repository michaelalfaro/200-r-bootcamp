### Pre Bootcamp workout
Welcome to EEB 201, R Bootcamp for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. The goal of this course is to provide a foundation for skills in scientific programming in the R environment. Check out the syllabus for more details [link].

This is an intensive, high speed roller coaster type bootcamp that includes sudden and dramatic acceleration, climbing, and plotting. To prepare for the course **you must complete the following assignments *before* the workshop begins on September 16th.** These pre-assignments count for 1/3rd of your grade in course.

- install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and work through the [getting started](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/) and [contributing to projects](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/) tutorials. **Create a github repository for bootcamp assignments.** You will be posting all assignments to this repository and sharing it with the instructors for evaluation.
- install [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) on your computer  along with the packages APE, GEIGER, and ggplot2. You may wish to install [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a slick IDE for R as well.
- work through **sections 1-4 and 6** on the [Try R code schools web page](http://tryr.codeschool.com/). This page awards "badges" as you complete sections. Please **use githib to commit screenshots of your badges as you complete your work**. This will give you practice using the git version control workflow and allow us to see you progress through the exercises.
- Once you have finished the code school exercises,  work through examples in [Primer of Ecology with R](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-89882-7), Appendix B 341-352 (skip 'Simple matrix algebra'), + optional B4, B6, B13. Do this work on a separate day to reinforce your developing programmign skills.  **Use your github repo to commit your work.** There should be at least two commits for each group of exercises. 
- If you are new to R and/or programming, have a look at[A Beginner's Guide to R](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-93837-0), Ch 1,2,3,5,6. **. This book is focused on the R environment and not on statistics and can be a handy reference when you find yourself cursing at R's idiosyncrasies....
