### Pre Bootcamp workout
Welcome to EEB 201, R Bootcamp for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, 2020 Zoom edition. The goal of this course is to provide a broad introduction to scientific programming in the R environment. Ideally the skills you begin to develop in this course will be refined over your first year as you take classes in the core series and begin your own research.  Check out the [syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/EEB_201_syllabus_2020.pdf) for more details.

#### Preparation
To get things started, we would like you to get R installed and complete some of an interactive R course. We will use a great learning system called Swirl (http://swirlstats.com/).  Mysteriously, that website has been down for the past few days... if it remains down, then you can access the content via the swirl github repository or via an internet archive such as the Wayback machine.  If you are new to R, then the archived version of the full site might be a bit friendlier since it gives instructions on installing R and RStudio to get started (via the Learn tab). 
 
Once you have R and RStudio installed, please install Swirl, start it, and follow the instructions to install the 'R programming E' course.   We would like you to complete Lessons 1-9 and 15 in this online course, before Sept 22 when our course begins.  Please take and save screen shots at the end of each lesson to document that you have completed the exercises.  Feel free to explore further, with this course or any of the huge variety of other courses offered within Swirl.  Please let us know if you have any difficulties with the install.

<!-- This is an intensive, high speed roller coaster type bootcamp that includes sudden and dramatic acceleration, climbing, and plotting. To prepare for the course **you must complete the following assignments *before* the workshop begins on September 22nd.** These pre-assignments count for 1/3rd of your grade in course.

- install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and work this tutorial on [version control](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Also have a look at [this intro to git](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/). **Create a github repository for bootcamp assignments.** You will be posting all assignments to this repository and sharing it with the instructors for evaluation.
- install [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) on your computer  along with the packages APE, GEIGER, and ggplot2. You may wish to install [R studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), a slick IDE for R as well.
- work through **sections 1-4 and 6** on the [Try R code schools web page](http://tryr.codeschool.com/). This page awards "badges" as you complete sections. Please **use githib to commit screenshots of your badges as you complete your work**. This will give you practice using the git version control workflow and allow us to see you progress through the exercises.
- Once you have finished the code school exercises,  review sections **1-8** of [this tutorial](https://kingaa.github.io/R_Tutorial/) and work through as much as possible of the exercises in sections **9.1-9.3, 9.6, 11, and 12**. Do this work on a separate day to reinforce your developing programming skills.  **Use your github repo to commit your work.** There should be at least two commits for each group of exercises. 
- If you are new to R and/or programming, have a look at [A Beginner's Guide to R](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-93837-0), Ch 1,2,3,5,6. **. This book is focused on the R environment and not on statistics and can be a handy reference when you find yourself cursing at R's idiosyncrasies.... 


### How do I turn my stuff in?

Two ways!  

**I have version control working**
Paste the address to your github repository [here](http://tinyurl.com/bootcamp-repos). 
  
**Version control make Hulk mad!!!**
Paste an email associated with your Dropbox account [here](https://tinyurl.com/bootcamp-db-emails). Then, once I invite you to the folder, create a subfolder with your assignments. -->

### Schedule

The course sessions will be held across four days, Sept 22, 23, 29, and 30.  Each day, there will be a Zoom instruction session in the morning from 9:30 until roughly 11:30, and there will be an online support/co-working session in the afternoon to work on the assigned exercises with your peers.  These sessions will be supported by current EEB grad students and postdocs, and they are intended to be a supportive and friendly way to get your questions answered.  Timing on the afternoon sessions is TBD, but they are informal and you can step out for a while if you need to, so feel free to schedule committee meetings on these afternoons. 
 
The purpose of the bootcamp is to get you up and running with R, and to teach you some basic programming.  We don't expect any background knowledge (beyond what you learn from the assigned prep work), and we are not evaluating or judging you.  It will be a supportive and inclusive environment, with the sole purpose of giving you a boost in your graduate work.  We will ask you to complete and submit some exercises, since this is very much a 'learn by doing' topic, but we are not assigning letter grades.
